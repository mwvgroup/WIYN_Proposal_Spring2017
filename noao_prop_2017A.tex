% SUMMARY OF OBSERVING RUNS REQUESTED
%
% List a summary of the details of the observing runs being requested,
% for UP TO SIX runs.  The parameters for each run are segregated
% between \begin{obsrun} and \end{obsrun} lines.  Please be sure
% that the information is isolated properly for each run.
%
%   \begin{obsrun}
%   \telescope{}        % For example, \telescope{KP-4m}
%   \instrument{}       % For example, \instrument{ECHUV + T2KB}
%   \numnights{}        % For example, \numnights{6}
%   \lunardays{}        % For example, \lunardays{grey}
%   \optimaldates{}     % For example, \optimaldates{Sep - Nov}
%   \acceptabledates{}  % For example, \acceptabledates{Aug - Jan}
%   \end{obsrun}
%
% The following telescope identifiers MUST be used in the \telescope{}
% field.  Some of the telescope identifiers must include an observatory
% code as well.
%
% CTIO: CT-4m, SOAR, CT-1.5m, CT-1.3m, CT-0.9m
% KPNO: KP-4m, WIYN, KP-0.9m
% AAO: AAT
% CHARA: CHARA
%
% Select the instrument and detector identifiers from the list on our
% Web page at https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.noao.edu%2Fnoaoprop%2Fhelp%2Ffacilities.html&data=01%7C01%7Ckap146%40pitt.edu%7C6f8fc2f751be47ae990208d3e317779d%7C9ef9f489e0a04eeb87cc3a526112fd0d%7C1&sdata=xzUfvUtUpc%2BsBGd9VEUtvVAoVY5SzAPxhuL7PpoDJf4%3D&reserved=0.
% The correct codes MUST be used to ensure your correct
% instrument + detector combination.
%
% \numnights should give the number of nights of the run (for queue
% observations, use fractional 10-hour equivalent nights, e.g.
% 3 hours = 0.3 nights).  Formats such as 5x0.5 are acceptable.
%
% \lunardays should contain the word "darkest", "dark", "grey", or
% "bright", which in turn reflects the number of nights from new moon
% where darkest<=3, dark<=7, grey<=10, bright<=14.  Particular lunar 
% phase requirements dictated by the science program (e.g., "<=12", 
% "+9, -6", or "full moon more than 2 hours away from Taurus") should
% be noted in the "scheduling constraints or non-usable dates" section 
% below.
%
% \optimaldates should contain the range of OPTIMAL months, as shown 
% below.
%
% \acceptabledates should give the range of ACCEPTABLE months (i.e.,
% you would not accept time outside those limits).
% NOTE THAT DUE TO INSTRUMENT BLOCKING RESTRICTIONS YOU SHOULD MAKE 
% THIS RANGE AS GENEROUS AS POSSIBLE.
%
% For QUEUE-SCHEDULED observations, you may set the date range to the 
% full semester range and set \lunardays to the brightest moon your
% observations could tolerate if the program were scheduled classically.
%
% To enter the acceptable and optimal date ranges, please use two
% dash-separated months with 3-letter abbreviations for the month
% (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec).
% For example:  \optimaldates{Nov - Dec}.
% We appreciate your help in not using vague range specifications
% like "October dark run" or "mid-January" which will require human
% intervention.
%
% FOR LONGTERM STATUS PROPOSALS SPECIFY ONLY THE RUNS FOR THE CURRENT
% SEMESTER, AND NOT FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT SEMESTERS.

% DO NOT remove any of the \begin{obsrun} and \end{obsrun} blocks, 
% even if the blocks are empty.

% SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION
%
% Give the scientific justification for the proposed observations.
% This section should consist of paragraphs of text followed by any
% references and up to three figures and captions.  Be sure to include
% overall significance to astronomy.  THE SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION
% SHOULD BE LIMITED TO ONE PAGE (the review panels have requested that
% we not send them more than one page), with up to two additional pages
% for references, figures (no more than three), and captions. 

% If you wish to use our "reference" environment, follow the following

% Only EPS figures may be included with your proposal.  In order to
% include an EPS plot, you should use the LaTeX "figure" environment.
% The plot file is included with the \plotone{FILENAME} command; two
% side-by-side plot files can be included by typing
% \plottwo{FILENAME1}{FILENAME2}.  Use \caption{} to specify a caption.
% The \epsscale{} command can be used to scale \plotone plots if they

% EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
%
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% There is a limit of one page of printed text.

% Describe your overall observational program.  How will these 
% observations contribute toward the accomplishment of the goals 
% outlined in the science justification?  If you've requested 
% long-term status, justify why this is necessary for successful 
% completion of the science.
%
% NOTE: In previous versions of the proposal form, this section
% requested details about the use of non-NOAO observing facilities. 
% Such information should now be entered in the following "Other
% Facilities" section.

\expdesign

% PROPRIETARY PERIOD
% 
% Enter the proprietary period for your data between the braces.
% The normal duration is 18 months from when the data are taken at
% the telescope.  Requests for longer proprietary periods must
% be approved by the NOAO Director.

\proprietaryperiod{18 months}


% OTHER FACILITIES OR RESOURCES
% 
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% Please limit to about a half page of printed text.
% 
% 1) We are interested in understanding how observations made through
% NOAO observing opportunities complement or support data from other
% facilities both on the ground and in space.   We will use this
% information to guide the evolution of the NOAO program; it will not
% affect the success of your proposal in the evaluation process.
% Please describe how the proposed observations complement data from  
% other facilities, including private observatories and both ground-
% and space-based telescopes.  In addressing this question, take a
% broad view of your research program.  Are the data to be obtained 
% through this proposal going to help select samples for detailed
% observations using larger telescopes or from space observatories?
% Are these data going to be directly combined with data obtained
% elsewhere to test a hypothesis?  Will these observations have
% relevance to other observations, even though the proposal stands
% on its own?  For each of these other facilities, indicate the nature
% of the observations (yours or those of others), and describe the
% importance of the observations proposed here in the context of the
% entire program.
%
% 2) Do you currently have a grant that would provide resources
% to support the data processing, analysis, and publication of the
% observations proposed here?

% LONG-TERM DETAILS
%
% If you are requesting long-term status for this proposal briefly 
% state the requirements for telescope time (telescope, instrument, 
% number of nights) needed in subsequent semesters to complete this 
% project in \longtermdetails (be sure to uncomment the 
% \longtermdetails line below).
%
% If this is a long-term request you MAY ALSO NEED to modify the
% \proposaltype keyword at the top of this form changing "Standard"
% to "Longterm" (where is says "Please do not modify or delete this 
% line!").  It is this keyword that will flag this proposal as a 
% long-term status request, regardless of what may be entered here 
% in \longtermdetails!
%
% If this is not a long-term status request then please ignore this
% section.
%
%
%\longtermdetails


% PAST USE
%
% How effectively have you used the facilities available through NOAO
% in the past?
% List allocations of telescope time on facilities available through 
% NOAO to the Principal Investigator during the past 2 years, together 
% with the current status of the data (cite publications where 
% appropriate).  Mark any allocations of time related to the current 
% proposal with a \relatedwork{} command.

% COORDINATE RANGES OF PRINCIPLE TARGETS   
% Use the \targetsra and \targetsdec fields to specify the range
% of right ascension (in hours) and declination (in degrees) of your
% principle targets for this observing run.
%
% For example:
%
%  \targetsra{14 to 17}
%  \targetsdec{-10 to 35}

\targetsra{12 to 19}			% RA range in hours
\targetsdec{-14 to +44}			% Dec. range in degrees



% Use \specialrequest to describe briefly any special or non-standard
% usage of instrumentation. 
\specialrequest


% If you plan to submit any Target Tables for this run they must be
% entered here.  Target Tables are required for all queue runs.

% TARGET TABLES
%
% Target Tables are required for all queue runs and are
% are optional for classically scheduled runs.  Target
% Tables, if included, are associated with each run in the observing
% run details section of the proposal form and must follow the 
% \specialrequest in each section.
%
% CT-1.3m tables require that all the fields in the target table be
% specified.  For other tables specific fields may be deleted EXCEPT 
% for the \obscomment command as mentioned below.
%
% Queue investigators should supply good coordinates
% with the \ra and \dec commands since these values may be used to
% observe your fields.
%
% Note that for iterative targets, only the parameters that need
% to be changed have to be specified.  Once a parameter is specified in
% a targettable environment, it is retained until explicitly changed.
%
% The \obscomment command is REQUIRED for each target entry and
% must be the last item; this command forces each target line to be
% printed.  If no comment is needed, leave the argument blank.
%
% The \begin{targettable}{} command for each table must contain the
% telescope/instrument-detector information for that particular run,
% i.e,. \begin{targettable}{KP-4m/ECHUV + T2KB}.
%
% HINTS: Long tables do not break across pages. If it is necessary to
% continue a table across a page you must start a new table.  Use
% /clearpage before the \begin{targettable} command for the new table.
