\begin{abstract}

We ask for one night of WIYN+WHIRC time to obtain two last host galaxy template images
to complete the SweetSpot program to observe Type Ia supernovae in the NIR (2012B-0500).
The originally approved SweetSpot observed 114 Type Ia supernovae during its six semester run. 
Host galaxy template images were gathered during the main survey and in additional time allotted in 2015B and 2016A semesters (2012B-0500, 2015B-0347). 
We require two more host galaxy template observations to assemble all necessary reference images to allow accurate measurement of the supernova flux, and thus distance, for the supernovae observed in the last semesters of SweetSpot.
We will also take this opportunity to complete a network of standard stars spanning a wide color range
to improve the the calibration of WIYN's GPS-based precipitable water vapor measurement system.

{\bf How Standard are Type Ia Supernovae Standard Candles in the Near-Infrared?} 
In our quest toward precision measurements of dark energy with Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa)~\cite{astier06,wood-vasey07,kowalski08,hicken09b,kessler09,conley11,betoule14} we have became limited by 
systematic errors due to our incomplete understanding of SNIa colors, dust, and 
their host environments.
SNeIa are superior distance
indicators in the NIR, with more standard peak $H$ magnitudes and
relative insensitivity to reddening
\cite{meikle00,krisciunas04a,krisciunas07}. 
As a result, unlike optical Type Ia SNe, which are {\em standardizable} candles,
 NIR SNe Ia
appear to be truly {\em standard} candles at the $\sim0.10$--$0.15$ mag
level ($\sim5$--$7\%$ in distance)
\cite{krisciunas04a,krisciunas05a,wood-vasey08,folatelli10,weyant11,barone-nugent12,kattner12}.

Motivated by this opportunity, the ``SweetSpot'' (PI Wood-Vasey; \cite{weyant11}) and the ``CSP-II'' (PI M. Phillips; \cite{contreras10,stritzinger11}) programs were undertaken to build a comprehensive sample of SNeIa observed in the NIR in the nearby Hubble flow.
The scientific goals of SweetSpot are:
{\bf (1)}
Testing if SNeIa are better standard candles in the NIR.
{\bf (2)}
Breaking the color-dust degeneracy with NIR observations.
{\bf (3)}
Investigating the nature of SNIa host galaxies using NIR and optical observations
{\bf (4)}
Connecting local flows and motions with SNIa NIR to galaxies and convergence.

Throughout the SweetSpot program, we have devoted time to obtain needed host galaxies templates for SNeIa from the previous year.  
We requested 6 additional nights in the 2015B--2016A semesters to finish host galaxy templates from the last original SweetSpot year of 2014B-2015A.  
We obtained 12 host galaxy template observations during this awarded extension time, but unfortunately a bit of poor weather in 2016A prevented us from finishing the last 2 host galaxy observations.
We here request one more night of WIYN+WHIRC time to observe the two host galaxies from the final year of SweetSpot (2014B--2015A).
Without these final host galaxy template references, we will not be able to produce lightcurves for these two supernovae.

Obtaining final host galaxy images free from the contamination of the SN light will be critical in obtaining accurate apparent brightness measurements for the SN light curve.  These observations will also help provide measurements of the host galaxy stellar mass along with detailed morphology.

{\bf Improved Calibration:}\\
A dual-band GPS system was installed at KPNO in 2015 March to measure the variable amount of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere.  
This system is a key part of determining the full effective system transmission function in the NIR (and in general for $\lambda>700$~nm), where the edges of the filter bandpasses can be affected by the variable absorption lines from water vapor.  
Observing the same fields for these 2 supernovae and the standard SweetSpot calibration star fields with the dual-band GPS system running for another semester will provide important information to tie down our WIYN+WHIRC magnitudes of the stars in the SN fields we use for calibration.  
The supernova host galaxy observations should take 6 total hours.
We plan to use the remaining few hours in the requested night to observe additional Persson standard stars that span a wider range of colors than the select handful we used for consistency across all of the nights.
This greater color range will help calibrate the color term of the WIYN+WHIRC system with the additional benefit of known the water vapor absorption in the NIR during these nights.
We will use the focus of spending this additional time with the system to provide to all KPNO users the water absorption spectral response function based on the observations of the GPS PWV system throughout the time it has been on the mountain.

% EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
%
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% There is a limit of one page of printed text.

% Describe your overall observational program.  How will these 
% observations contribute toward the accomplishment of the goals 
% outlined in the science justification?  If you've requested 
% long-term status, justify why this is necessary for successful 
% completion of the science.
%
% NOTE: In previous versions of the proposal form, this section
% requested details about the use of non-NOAO observing facilities. 
% Such information should now be entered in the following "Other
% Facilities" section.

\expdesign

We request a total of 1 night for WHIRC observations of host galaxies of SNeIa and standard stars.  

We will observe the 2 host galaxies from SweetSpot that will
require template observations due to significant inferred host galaxy light contributions at the location of the SNeIa.
We are only requiring one filter per object. 
We have gathered the other 1--2 filters in previous semesters but were unable to observe these two due to poor weather in 2016A. 

We will also observe several standard stars in all 3 filters throughout the night.

These observations will be undertaken with WHIRC in $J$, $H$, and $K_s$
and provide reference flux values critical to obtaining
SN lightcurves and improved PWV calibration.  
The host galaxy observations will also generate
maps of the host galaxy at the high resolutions offered by the WIYN+WHIRC system for general study of detailed NIR morphology and host galaxy mass.

% PROPRIETARY PERIOD
% 
% Enter the proprietary period for your data between the braces.
% The normal duration is 18 months from when the data are taken at
% the telescope.  Requests for longer proprietary periods must
% be approved by the NOAO Director.

\proprietaryperiod{18 months}


% OTHER FACILITIES OR RESOURCES
% 
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% Please limit to about a half page of printed text.
% 
% 1) We are interested in understanding how observations made through
% NOAO observing opportunities complement or support data from other
% facilities both on the ground and in space.   We will use this
% information to guide the evolution of the NOAO program; it will not
% affect the success of your proposal in the evaluation process.
% Please describe how the proposed observations complement data from  
% other facilities, including private observatories and both ground-
% and space-based telescopes.  In addressing this question, take a
% broad view of your research program.  Are the data to be obtained 
% through this proposal going to help select samples for detailed
% observations using larger telescopes or from space observatories?
% Are these data going to be directly combined with data obtained
% elsewhere to test a hypothesis?  Will these observations have
% relevance to other observations, even though the proposal stands
% on its own?  For each of these other facilities, indicate the nature
% of the observations (yours or those of others), and describe the
% importance of the observations proposed here in the context of the
% entire program.
%
% 2) Do you currently have a grant that would provide resources
% to support the data processing, analysis, and publication of the
% observations proposed here?

\otherfacilities

1. These observations will complement the data from other nearby supernova groups such as KAIT, the CfA Supernova group, and the Carnegie Supernova Project to produce the most complementary data sets to enable explorations of optical vs. NIR distance estimation, color, and host galaxy properties.
The first steps toward higher redshift are currently being undertaken on {\it HST} through the RAISIN project (PI R. Kirshner).
Farther in the future and going farther in the past, the nearby NIR SNIa set will provide a reference anchor for future higher-redshift restframe NIR work with {\it JWST} and {\it WFIRST}.

2. The PI is currently funded by NSF AST-1028162 to carry out the SweetSpot program and related nearby SNIa work.  This grant will continue to support graduate students to do the observations, analysis and publications for these proposed observations.

% LONG-TERM DETAILS
%
% If you are requesting long-term status for this proposal briefly 
% state the requirements for telescope time (telescope, instrument, 
% number of nights) needed in subsequent semesters to complete this 
% project in \longtermdetails (be sure to uncomment the 
% \longtermdetails line below).
%
% If this is a long-term request you MAY ALSO NEED to modify the
% \proposaltype keyword at the top of this form changing "Standard"
% to "Longterm" (where is says "Please do not modify or delete this 
% line!").  It is this keyword that will flag this proposal as a 
% long-term status request, regardless of what may be entered here 
% in \longtermdetails!
%
% If this is not a long-term status request then please ignore this
% section.
%
%
%\longtermdetails


% PAST USE
%
% How effectively have you used the facilities available through NOAO
% in the past?
% List allocations of telescope time on facilities available through 
% NOAO to the Principal Investigator during the past 2 years, together 
% with the current status of the data (cite publications where 
% appropriate).  Mark any allocations of time related to the current 
% proposal with a \relatedwork{} command.

\thepast

This proposal will provide the final data necessary to complete our NOAO Survey 
program ``Type Ia Supernovae in the Near-Infrared: A Three-Year Survey toward a One Percent Distance Measurement with WIYN+WHIRC'' \relatedwork{2012B-0500},
and a final installment of WHIRC host galaxy templates that went uncompleted in the follow up program
``Final Host Galaxy Observations for `SweetSpot': Calibrating the Supernova Host Galaxy Light and Environment''
\relatedwork{2015B-0347}.
We observed 114 SNeIa and 1 SN Ibn (SN 2015G) during the main program.
The first results from this Survey were published in \cite{weyant11}.  
A first data release paper with 74 SNeIa and 31 light curves is currently in preparation and anticipated to be submitted for publication this fall.
Final data reductions of all targets have already begun in preparation for the second and full data release

PI Wood-Vasey was involved in the 6-year ESSENCE Supernova Survey (PI Suntzeff) that used the CTIO 4.0-m Blanco telescope to discover and study 213 Type Ia Supernovae to measure the dark energy equation-of-state during the past 8 billion years.  This survey has so far led to 10 refereed publications that have been cited a combined 1,657 times.

\technicaldescription

We need to obtain 2 host galaxy references. 
Observations need to be at least 3 times as long as the longest exposure of the field when the supernova was live (assuming 1\arcsec\ seeing).
Our template observations need have better signal to noise than our supernova observations for accurate template subtractions. 
LSQ14xi was observed in J for 41 minutes:  its host galaxy needs 123 minutes which translates to five 5x5x15\arcsec\ scripts yielding 125 open shutter minutes.
ASASSN-15fs was observed in Ks for 16 minutes: its host galaxy needs 48 minutes which translates to two 5x5x15\arcsec\ scripts yielding 50 open shutter minutes.
Each dither script takes $\sim$ 33 minutes to run for a total of 3.8 hours, plus $\sim40$ minutes to set up both fields (check focus, position, use WTTM if possible).
We need roughly an hour and a half for standard star observations.
This totals to approximately 6 hours or 1 night in April or May.
Any extra time can be filled with standard star observations.

Nights do not need to be photometric. 
The night sky is bright in the NIR regardless of the phase of the Moon; therefore, observations during bright time are acceptable. 

% Several instrument configuration parameters are requested.  Fill
% these in as appropriate for each run.

% If you plan to submit any Target Tables for this run they must be
% entered here.  Target Tables are required for all queue runs.

% TARGET TABLES
%
% Target Tables are required for all queue runs and are
% are optional for classically scheduled runs.  Target
% Tables, if included, are associated with each run in the observing
% run details section of the proposal form and must follow the 
% \specialrequest in each section.
%
% CT-1.3m tables require that all the fields in the target table be
% specified.  For other tables specific fields may be deleted EXCEPT 
% for the \obscomment command as mentioned below.
%
% Queue investigators should supply good coordinates
% with the \ra and \dec commands since these values may be used to
% observe your fields.
%
% Note that for iterative targets, only the parameters that need
% to be changed have to be specified.  Once a parameter is specified in
% a targettable environment, it is retained until explicitly changed.
%
% The \obscomment command is REQUIRED for each target entry and
% must be the last item; this command forces each target line to be
% printed.  If no comment is needed, leave the argument blank.
%
% The \begin{targettable}{} command for each table must contain the
% telescope/instrument-detector information for that particular run,
% i.e,. \begin{targettable}{KP-4m/ECHUV + T2KB}.
%
% HINTS: Long tables do not break across pages. If it is necessary to
% continue a table across a page you must start a new table.  Use
% /clearpage before the \begin{targettable} command for the new table.
